** Lyrics
*** Wyclef Jean / Akon - Sweetest Girl
*[Intro: (Wyclef Jean (Lil Wayne)]*
Some live for the bill 
Some kill for the bill 
She wined for the bill 
Grind for the bill 
(And she used to be the sweetest girl) 
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill 
(And she used to be the sweetest girl) 
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy and Nia 

*[Verse 1: (Wyclef Jean)]*
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym 
(Just to get a peek again, she’s a 10) 
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym 
(Just to get a peek again, she’s a 10) 
Never thought she would come and work for the president 
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?) 
She thought he’d call (where my money at?) 
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day 
All you wanna know is (where my money at?) 
Closed legs don’t get fed, go out there and make my bread 
All you wanna know is (where my money at?) 
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard 
All you wanna know is (where my money at?) 
She thought he’d call (where my money at?) 

*[Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2)*
Cos’ I’ma tell you like Wu told me 
Cash rules everything around me 
Singin’ dollar dollar bill y’all (dollar, dollar bill y’all) 
Singin’ dollar dollar bill y’all(dollar, dollar bill y’all) 

*[Verse 2: (Akon)]*
Pimpin’ got harder cos’, hoes got smarter 
On the strip is something they don’t wanna be a part of 
Rather be up in the club shakin’ for a thug 
For triple times the money and spending it like they wanna 
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind 
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines 
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind 
And ain’t nobody takin’ from us, and that’s the bottom line 
But I know, there’s a drop in the block 
You move slow, you getting’ pressure from cops 
You don’t know, not to lay low 
Because 25 to life’s no joke 
To all my real gorillas thuggin’ 
On top of corners every day strugglin’ 
All the beautiful women gettin’ money 
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry 

*[Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2)*
Cos’ I’ma tell you like Wu told me 
Cash rules everything around me 
Singin’ dollar dollar bill y’all (dollar, dollar bill y’all) 
Singin’ dollar dollar bill y’all(dollar, dollar bill y’all) 

*[Bridge: (Wyclef Jean)]*
Money, money-money-money 
Money, money-money-money 
It drives the world crazy 

*[Verse 3: (Lil Wayne)]*
(Weezy) She used to be (she used to be the sweetest girl) 

She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Now she like sour ameretta
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him… (in the background Weezy- Where my money at?)



*[Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2)*
Cos’ I’ma tell you like Wu told me 
Cash rules everything around me 
Singin’ dollar dollar bill y’all (dollar, dollar bill y’all) 
Singin’ dollar dollar bill y’all(dollar, dollar bill y’all) 


*[Outro: (Wyclef Jean)]*
Some live for the bill 
Some kill for the bill (where my money at?) 
She wined for the bill 
Grind for the bill (where my money at?) 
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill (where my money at?) 
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy and Nia
